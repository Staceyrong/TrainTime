# TrainTime
 In this assignment, I'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

1. When the user inputs the ingormation, the page will show the new train schedule.
2. Those information will save in the firebase.
3. When you refresh the page, the new train schedule will still show in the page.
